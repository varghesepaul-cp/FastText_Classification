__label__0	I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.
__label__1	Have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!!
__label__1	Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.
__label__1	The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.
__label__0	I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.
__label__1	The atmosphere here is fun.
__label__0	Would not recommend to others.
__label__1	"Service is quick and even ""to go"" orders are just like we like it!"
__label__0	"I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!"
__label__1	"That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased."
__label__0	Not my thing.
__label__1	2 Thumbs Up!!
__label__0	If you are reading this please don't go there.
__label__1	"I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza."
__label__1	Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!
__label__1	They have a really nice atmosphere.
__label__0	Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.
__label__1	"After one bite, I was hooked."
__label__0	We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.
__label__1	"Cute, quaint, simple, honest."
__label__1	The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.
__label__1	"The food was great as always, compliments to the chef."
__label__1	Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.
__label__1	Awesome selection of beer.
__label__1	Great food and awesome service!
__label__1	"One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that."
__label__0	A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!
__label__1	The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.
__label__1	"As for the service, I thought it was good."
__label__0	"The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us."
__label__0	Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.
__label__1	Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.
__label__1	"Overall, I like there food and the service."
__label__1	They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.
__label__0	"Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it."
__label__0	"Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it."
__label__1	"Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service."
__label__1	I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.
__label__1	Never had anything to complain about here.
__label__1	The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.
__label__0	It was way over fried.
__label__0	I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.
__label__0	"When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way."
__label__0	Will not be back!
__label__1	There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.
__label__1	An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.
__label__1	"I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from."
__label__0	"I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!"
__label__1	Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
__label__1	"I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette."
__label__1	"The wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth."
__label__1	"Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn't over-whelm the soup."
__label__1	We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!
__label__0	"Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up."
__label__1	"When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!"
__label__0	I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.
__label__1	This is a GREAT place to eat!
__label__1	The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.
__label__0	The service was poor and thats being nice.
__label__1	"Food was good, service was good, Prices were good."
__label__0	The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!
__label__0	"The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather."
__label__0	But the service was beyond bad.
__label__1	"I'm so happy to be here!!!"""
__label__0	Tasted like dirt.
__label__1	One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .
__label__1	The block was amazing.
__label__1	"It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food."
__label__1	* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!
__label__0	My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.
__label__1	Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.
__label__0	"the food is not tasty at all, not to say its ""real traditional Hunan style""."
__label__0	"What did bother me, was the slow service."
__label__1	The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!
__label__0	Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.
__label__1	These were so good we ordered them twice.
__label__0	So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.
__label__0	My girlfriend's veal was very bad.
__label__0	"Unfortunately, it was not good."
__label__1	I had a pretty satifying experience.
__label__1	Join the club and get awesome offers via email.
__label__1	"Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder."
__label__0	Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.
__label__0	"The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily."
__label__1	The nachos are a MUST HAVE!
__label__0	We will not be coming back.
__label__1	"I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well."
__label__1	"The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff."
__label__1	"Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service."
__label__1	When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.
__label__0	Once your food arrives it's meh.
__label__0	Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.
__label__1	The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.
__label__0	"My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too."
__label__1	So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.
__label__1	"The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh."
__label__1	This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0	Mediocre food.
__label__1	Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.
__label__0	I'm super pissd.
__label__1	And service was super friendly.
__label__0	Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?
__label__1	This place was such a nice surprise!
__label__1	They were golden-crispy and delicious.
__label__0	"I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat."
__label__1	I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.
__label__0	Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.
__label__1	"Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered."
__label__1	"The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was."
__label__0	The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!
__label__0	The service was terrible though.
__label__0	"This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!"
__label__0	It was packed!!
__label__1	I love this place.
__label__1	I can say that the desserts were yummy.
__label__0	The food was terrible.
__label__1	The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.
__label__0	It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.
__label__0	This place should honestly be blown up.
__label__0	But I definitely would not eat here again.
__label__0	Do not waste your money here!
__label__1	I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.
__label__1	The crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.
__label__0	Awful service.
__label__0	Won't ever go here again.
__label__0	Food quality has been horrible.
__label__0	For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.
__label__0	The service here is fair at best.
__label__0	"I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services."
__label__0	Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.
__label__0	Very poor service.
__label__0	No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.
__label__1	"Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day."
__label__1	They were excellent.
__label__0	I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.
__label__1	Just had lunch here and had a great experience.
__label__0	I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.
__label__0	Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.
__label__1	I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!
__label__0	"for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food."
__label__1	The food came out at a good pace.
__label__1	"I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad."
__label__0	I won't be back.
__label__0	We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!
__label__0	This place deserves no stars.
__label__0	I would not recommend this place.
__label__1	"In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome."
__label__0	"To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted."
__label__0	"Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!"
__label__1	the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.
__label__0	I probably would not go here again.
__label__1	So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.
__label__1	The price is reasonable and the service is great.
__label__0	"The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either."
__label__0	My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.
__label__1	"Went in for happy hour, great list of wines."
__label__1	Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!
__label__0	I probably won't be coming back here.
__label__0	Worst food/service I've had in a while.
__label__1	"This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant."
__label__1	Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.
__label__0	"Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil."
__label__1	I love their fries and their beans.
__label__1	Always a pleasure dealing with him.
__label__1	"They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval."
__label__1	This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.
__label__1	"For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go."
__label__1	"The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table."
__label__0	The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.
__label__0	"I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one."
__label__0	this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.
__label__1	"All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting."
__label__1	My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.
__label__0	Weird vibe from owners.
__label__0	There was hardly any meat.
__label__0	I've had better bagels from the grocery store.
__label__1	Go To Place for Gyros.
__label__1	"I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!"
__label__0	"Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless."
__label__0	I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.
__label__0	"The service was terrible, food was mediocre."
__label__1	We definately enjoyed ourselves.
__label__0	I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.
__label__0	"On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate."
__label__0	I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.
__label__0	The service was extremely slow.
__label__0	"After 20 minutes wait, I got a table."
__label__1	Seriously killer hot chai latte.
__label__0	"No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts."
__label__1	My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.
__label__1	Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.
__label__0	Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.
__label__0	Worst Thai ever.
__label__1	If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.
__label__1	I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.
__label__1	The pizza selections are good.
__label__1	"I had strawberry tea, which was good."
__label__0	Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!
__label__1	"Overall, a great experience."
__label__0	Spend your money elsewhere.
__label__1	Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!
__label__0	The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.
__label__0	"And the drinks are WEAK, people!"
__label__0	#NAME?
__label__0	"Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house."
__label__0	After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.
__label__1	The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0	We won't be returning.
__label__1	This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.
__label__0	I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
__label__0	"Very, very sad."
__label__0	"i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?"
__label__0	"How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!"
__label__0	I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.
__label__0	The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.
__label__0	"There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better"
__label__0	I got food poisoning here at the buffet.
__label__0	They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!
__label__0	"What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us."
__label__0	"Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon."
__label__0	This place is disgusting!
__label__1	"Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree."
__label__0	The RI style calamari was a joke.
__label__0	"However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible."
__label__0	"I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch."
__label__0	"It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it."
__label__0	It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.
__label__0	We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!
__label__0	Disappointing experience.
__label__0	"The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all."
__label__0	"If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you."
__label__0	WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.
__label__0	We won't be going back.
__label__0	The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.
__label__0	This place lacked style!!
__label__0	"The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous."
__label__0	Don't bother coming here.
__label__0	"The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork."
__label__0	"The building itself seems pretty neat, the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again."
__label__0	It was equally awful.
__label__0	Probably not in a hurry to go back.
__label__0	very slow at seating even with reservation.
__label__0	Not good by any stretch of the imagination.
__label__0	The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.
__label__0	"The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat."
__label__0	"It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor."
__label__0	I was VERY disappointed!!
__label__0	This place is horrible and way overpriced.
__label__0	"Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best."
__label__0	It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.
__label__0	The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.
__label__0	"The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits."
__label__0	Con: spotty service.
__label__0	"The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger."
__label__0	But then they came back cold.
__label__0	"Then our food came out, disappointment ensued."
__label__0	The real disappointment was our waiter.
__label__0	My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.
__label__0	The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.
__label__0	"Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it."
__label__0	If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?
__label__0	She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.
__label__0	After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!
__label__0	Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.
__label__0	It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.
__label__0	But I don't like it.
__label__0	Hell no will I go back
__label__0	We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.
__label__0	"I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back ""ya'all""."
__label__0	I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.
__label__0	The ambiance isn't much better.
__label__0	"Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees."
__label__0	The food wasn't good.
__label__0	"Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked."
__label__0	What happened next was pretty....off putting.
__label__0	"too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place."
__label__0	Overpriced for what you are getting.
__label__0	I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.
__label__0	"I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food."
__label__0	"I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list."
__label__0	We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.
__label__0	Food was below average.
__label__0	It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.
__label__0	"All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop."
__label__0	The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).
__label__0	Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.
__label__0	"It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry."
__label__0	It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.
__label__0	I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.
__label__0	The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.
__label__0	Spend your money and time some place else.
__label__0	A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.
__label__0	the presentation of the food was awful.
__label__0	I can't tell you how disappointed I was.
__label__0	I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.
__label__0	Appetite instantly gone.
__label__0	Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.
__label__0	"The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time."
__label__0	"Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check."
